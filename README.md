# arium-2.0
--A decentralized, automatic, and free e-commerce app for the Ethereum network--

arium 2.0 is a decentralized app for the Ethereum network that enables automatic and free international e-commerce. Sellers simply prepare their products for shipping, register their product info in their local language, then sit back as revenue comes in automatically. The information is automatically sent to human translators, sponsors are automatically found who are paid to advertise the product on their YouTube channel, etc. and sales are generated automatically. When a purchase is made, the shipping company is notified automatically, and when the delivery is signed for, payment is automatically transferred. For more information, please read the arium 2.0 Technical White Paper.
